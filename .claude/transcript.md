00:00:06.720 hi i'm will from tested i'm more
00:00:07.839 fantastic today's app of the day is
00:00:09.440 called orbit one norman chain you should
00:00:11.440 tap to join
00:00:12.639 it's a four player game we're playing at
00:00:13.920 the same time up two yeah and this is
00:00:16.560 this is actually uh
00:00:18.640 multiple people on the same ipad at the
00:00:20.640 same time so you're going to have your
00:00:21.760 finger on my ipad while we play this
00:00:23.920 inappropriate so a time based game uh
00:00:26.560 and we each control a ship and it's just
00:00:29.039 to fly it's uh kind of osmo style so
00:00:31.519 it's a gravity game that red circle in
00:00:33.200 the middle has sun-like gravity so you
00:00:36.239 can do the little circles have gravity
00:00:38.239 as well uh the little circles do not
00:00:40.000 seem to have gravity little red circles
00:00:41.600 no no they're just bad
00:00:46.239 around the sun to go back in time that's
00:00:47.840 not gonna happen but it seems to not be
00:00:49.120 working uh you want to avoid the reds
00:00:51.199 red stuff and the other ship as well
00:00:54.000 because it will kill you and if i hold
00:00:55.360 on long enough i can turn around
00:00:57.199 yes exactly whoa there's not a lot of
00:00:59.520 complexity here this game is pretty fun
00:01:01.280 though uh gina and i played at fairmont
00:01:03.039 this weekend and quite enjoyed it uh you
00:01:05.199 and i are having a quite competitive
00:01:06.880 match moments ago
00:01:08.560 uh oh god so you're invisible invincible
00:01:12.080 oh you crazy space invader those are
00:01:14.560 worth more points the the ones are not

00:01:19.680 they just keep keep always be touching
00:01:22.240 green stuff
00:01:23.759 and avoiding the right
00:01:27.920 yeah there's a nice nice little combo
00:01:30.000 there oh look at those maneuvers there
00:01:32.159 are no
00:01:33.439 wow way to auger into the sun there chad
00:01:36.479 no don't fly too close to the sun said
00:01:38.240 uh pegasus no not pegasus
00:01:40.880 nope uh yeah it was dangerous
00:01:44.799 icarus was the one that yeah goes to the
00:01:46.640 side of this
00:01:48.479 mom and stuff wait that was oedipus
00:01:51.520 all those
00:01:54.640 oh look at that cluster of green but
00:01:56.640 yeah you mean the one i just scored on
00:01:58.479 jesus yeah look at this look at this
00:02:00.000 come from behind victory while i was
00:02:01.680 talking you were scoring
00:02:03.520 uh
00:02:04.320 let's talk more score
00:02:06.320 oh yeah look at that i'm in first place
00:02:08.800 oh my god 20 seconds left
00:02:11.760 oh you just exploded
00:02:14.879 no no no no so you think that this game
00:02:17.200 is about collecting stuff but really
00:02:19.040 it's about not dying because you lose a
00:02:20.400 point every time you die i know that
